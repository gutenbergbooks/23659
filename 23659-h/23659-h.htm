		<h2 class="section_title"><a class="pagenum" id="pagevii" title="vii"></a>A FOREWORD</h2>

		<p class="introduction">The following note, by the editor
		of the <em>American Magazine</em>, appeared
		in conjunction with the publication
		of this story in that magazine:</p>

		<p>In most of the biggest cities of
		the United States, from New York
		and Chicago down, you will find
		people who, every night of their
		lives, watch for and read in their
		evening paper an editorial by
		Frank Crane. These editorials
		are syndicated in a chain of thirty-eight
		newspapers, which reach
		many millions of readers. The
		grip which Crane has on these
		<a class="pagenum" id="pageviii" title="viii"></a>readers is tremendous. The reason
		is that the man has plenty of
		sensible ideas, which he presents
		simply and forcibly so that people
		get hold of them.</p>

		<p>In reality, Crane is a wonderful
		preacher. Years ago, in fact, he
		was the pastor of a great church
		in Chicago. But he left the pulpit
		and took up writing because he
		had the ability to interest millions,
		and could reach them only by
		means of the printing press.</p>

		<p>Doctor Crane lives in New York
		and does most of his work there.</p>
	</div>
	<div id="prelude">
		<h2 class="section_title"><a class="pagenum" id="pageix" title="ix"></a>PRELUDE</h2>

		<p>The voyager entering a new
		country will listen with attention
		to the traveller who is just returning
		from its exploration; and the
		young warrior buckling on his
		armour may be benefited by the
		experiences of the old warrior who
		is laying his armour off. I have
		climbed the Hill of Life, and am
		past the summit, <em>I suppose</em>, and
		perhaps it may help those just
		venturing the first incline to know
		what I think I would do if I had
		it to do over.</p>

		<p>I have lived an average life. I
		have had the same kind of follies,
		<a class="pagenum" id="pagex" title="x"></a>fears, and fires my twenty-one-year-old
		reader has. I have failed
		often and bitterly. I have loved
		and hated, lost and won, done
		some good deeds and many bad
		ones. I have had some measure
		of success and I have made about
		every kind of mistake there is to
		make. In other words, I have lived
		a full, active, human life, and have
		got thus far safely along.</p>

		<p>I am on the shady side of fifty.
		As people grow old they accumulate
		two kinds of spiritual supplies:
		one, a pile of doubts, questionings,
		and mysteries; and the other, a
		much smaller pile of positive conclusions.
		There is a great temptation
		to expatiate upon the former
		subjects, for negative and critical
		statements have a seductive appearance
		<a class="pagenum" id="pagexi" title="xi"></a>of depth and much more
		of a flavour of wisdom than clear
		and succinct declarations. But I
		will endeavour to resist this temptation,
		and will set down, as concisely
		as I can, some of the positive
		convictions I have gained.</p>

		<p>For the sake of orderly thought,
		I will make Ten Points. They
		might of course just as well be
		six points or forty, but ten seems
		to be the number most easily
		remembered, since we have ten
		fingers, first and &#8220;handiest&#8221; of
		counters.</p>

		IF I WERE TWENTY-ONE I WOULD<br />
		&#8220;DO THE NEXT THING&#8221;</h2>

		<p>The first duty of a human being
		in this world is to take himself
		off other people&#8217;s backs. I would
		go to work at something for which
		my fellow men would be willing to
		pay. I would not wait for an Ideal
		Job. The only ideal job I ever
		heard of was the one some other
		fellow had.</p>

		<p>It is quite important to find the
		<a class="pagenum" id="page4" title="4"></a>best thing to do. It is much more
		important to find something to
		do. If I were a young artist, I
		would paint soap advertisements,
		if that were all opportunity offered,
		until I got ahead enough to indulge
		in the painting of madonnas and
		landscapes. If I were a young
		musician, I would rather play in
		a street band than not at all. If
		I were a young writer, I would do
		hack work, if necessary, until I
		became able to write the Great
		American Novel.</p>

		<p>I would go to work. Nothing
		in all this world I have found is
		so good as work.</p>

		<p>I believe in the wage system as
		the best and most practical means
		of co&ouml;rdinating human effort.
		What spoils it is the large indigestible
		<a class="pagenum" id="page5" title="5"></a>lumps of unearned money
		that, because of laws that originated
		in special privilege, are injected
		into the body politic, by
		inheritance and other legal artificialities.</p>

		<p>If I were twenty-one I would
		resolve to take no dollar for which
		I had not contributed something
		in the world&#8217;s work. If a philanthropist
		gave me a million dollars
		I would decline it. If a rich
		father or uncle left me a fortune,
		I would hand it over to the city
		treasury. All great wealth units
		come, directly or indirectly, from
		the people and should go to them.
		All inheritance should be limited
		to, say, $100,000. If Government
		would do that there would be no
		trouble with the wage system.</p>

		<p><a class="pagenum" id="page6" title="6"></a>If I were twenty-one I would
		keep clean of endowed money.
		The happiest people I have known
		have been those whose bread and
		butter depended upon their daily
		exertion.</p>
	</div>
	<div  id="chapter_ii">
		<h2 class="chapter_title"><a class="pagenum" id="page7" title="7"></a><span class="chapter_number">II</span><br />
		IF I WERE TWENTY-ONE I WOULD<br />
		ADJUST MYSELF</h2>

		<p>More people I have known have
		suffered because they did not know
		how to adjust themselves than for
		any other reason. And the happiest-hearted
		people I have met have
		been those that have the knack
		of adapting themselves to whatever
		happens.</p>

		<p>I would begin with my relatives.
		While I might easily conceive a
		better set of uncles, aunts, cousins,
		brothers, and so on, yet Destiny
		<a class="pagenum" id="page8" title="8"></a>gave me precisely the relatives I
		need. I may not want them, but I
		need them. So of my friends and
		acquaintances and fellow workmen.
		Every man&#8217;s life is a plan of
		God. Fate brings to me the very
		souls out of the unknown that I
		ought to know. If I cannot get
		along with them, be happy and
		appreciated, I could not get along
		with another set of my own picking.
		A man who is looking for ideal
		human beings to make up his circle
		of acquaintances would as well go
		at once and jump into the river.</p>

		<p>The God of Things as They
		Ought to Be is a humbug. There
		is but one God, and He is the
		God of Things as They Are.</p>

		<p>Half of my problem is Me; the
		other half is Circumstances. My
		<a class="pagenum" id="page9" title="9"></a>task is to bring results out of the
		combination of the two.</p>

		<p>Life is not a science, to be
		learned; it is an art, to be practised.
		Ability comes by doing.
		Wisdom comes not from others; it
		is a secretion of experience.</p>

		<p>Life is not like a problem in
		arithmetic, to be solved by learning
		the rule; it is more like a puzzle
		of blocks, or wire rings&#8212;you
		just keep trying one way after
		another, until finally you succeed,
		maybe.</p>

		<p>I think it was Josh Billings who
		said that in the Game of Life, as
		in a game of cards, we have to
		play the cards dealt to us; and the
		good player is not the one who always
		wins, but the one who plays
		a poor hand well.</p>

		<h2 class="chapter_title"><a class="pagenum" id="page10" title="10"></a><span class="chapter_number">III</span><br />

		IF I WERE TWENTY-ONE I WOULD<br />
		TAKE CARE OF MY BODY</h2>

		<p>The comfort and efficiency of
		my days depend fundamentally
		upon the condition of this physical
		machine I am housed in. I would
		look out for it as carefully as I
		attend to my automobile, so that
		it might perform its functions
		smoothly and with the minimum
		of trouble.</p>

		<p>To this end I would note the
		four X&#8217;s. They are Examination,
		Excretion, Exercise, Excess.</p>

		<p><span class="subheading">Examination:</span> I would have
		<a class="pagenum" id="page11" title="11"></a>my body thoroughly inspected by
		intelligent scientists once a year.
		I do not believe in thinking too
		much about one&#8217;s health, but I
		believe in finding out the facts,
		and particularly the weaknesses,
		of one&#8217;s mechanism, before one
		proceeds to forget it.</p>

		<p><span class="subheading">Excretion:</span> By far the most
		important item to attend to in regard
		to the body is the waste
		pipes, including the colon, the
		bladder, and the pores. Most diseases
		have their origin in the colon.
		I would see to it that it was thoroughly
		cleaned every day. In
		addition, I would drink plenty of
		water, and would take some form
		of exercise every day that would
		induce perspiration. Most of my
		sicknesses have come from self-poisoning,
		<a class="pagenum" id="page12" title="12"></a>and I would make it my
		main care to eliminate the waste.</p>

		<p><span class="subheading">Exercise:</span> I would, if I were
		twenty-one, take up some daily
		system of exercise that would
		bring into play all the voluntary
		muscles of the body, and especially
		those which from my occupation
		tend to disuse. I would devote
		half an hour to an hour daily to
		this purpose.</p>

		<p><span class="subheading">Excess:</span> I would take no stimulant
		of any kind whatsoever.
		Whatever whips the body up to
		excess destroys the efficiency of
		the organism. Hence I would not
		touch alcoholic drinks in any form.
		If one never begins with alcohol
		he can find much more physical
		pleasure and power without it.
		The day of alcohol is past, with
		<a class="pagenum" id="page13" title="13"></a>intelligent people. Science has
		condemned it as a food. Business
		has banned it. It remains only as
		the folly of the weak and fatuous.</p>

		<p>I would drink no tea or coffee,
		as these are stimulants and not
		foods. Neither would I use tobacco.
		The healthy human body
		will furnish more of the joy of life,
		if it is not abused, than can be
		given by any of the artificial
		tonics which the ignorance and
		weakness of men have discovered.</p>

		<p>If I were twenty-one, all this!</p>
	</div>
	<div  id="chapter_iv">
		<h2 class="chapter_title"><a class="pagenum" id="page14" title="14"></a><span class="chapter_number">IV</span><br />

		IF I WERE TWENTY-ONE I WOULD<br />
		TRAIN MY MIND</h2>


		<p>I would realize that my eventual
		success depends mostly upon the
		quality and power of my brain.
		Hence I would train it so as to
		get the best out of it.</p>

		<p>Most of the failures I have seen,
		especially in professional life, have
		been due to mental laziness. I was
		a preacher for years, and found
		out that the greatest curse of the
		ministry is laziness. It is probably
		the same among lawyers and
		physicians. It certainly is so
		<a class="pagenum" id="page15" title="15"></a>among actors and writers. Hence,
		I would let no day pass without its
		period of hard, keen, mental exertion
		so that my mind would be
		always as a steel spring, or like a
		well-oiled engine, ready, resilient,
		and powerful.</p>

		<p>And in this connection I would
		recognize that repetition is better
		than effort. Mastery, perfection,
		the doing of difficult things with
		ease and precision, depend more
		upon doing things over and over
		than upon putting forth great
		effort.</p>

		<p>I would especially purge myself
		as far as possible of intellectual
		cowardice and intellectual dishonesty.
		By intellectual dishonesty
		I mean what is called expediency;
		that is, forming, or adhering
		<a class="pagenum" id="page16" title="16"></a>to, an opinion, not because we
		are convinced of its truth, but
		because of the effect it will have.
		A mind should, at twenty-one,
		marry Truth, and &#8220;cleave only
		unto her, till death do them part,
		for better, for worse.&#8221;</p>

		<p>By intellectual cowardice I mean
		all superstitions, premonitions, and
		other forms of mental paralysis or
		panic caused by what is vague.
		To heed signs, omens, cryptic
		sayings, and all talk of fate and
		luck, is nothing but mental dirt.
		I have seen many bright minds
		sullied by it. It is worthy only
		of the mind of an ignorant savage.</p>
	</div>
	<div id="chapter_v">
		<h2 class="chapter_title"><a class="pagenum" id="page17" title="17"></a><span class="chapter_number">V</span><br />

		IF I WERE TWENTY-ONE I WOULD<br />
		BE HAPPY</h2>


		<p>By this I imply that any one
		can be happy if he will. Happiness
		does not depend on circumstances,
		but upon Me.</p>

		<p>This is perhaps the greatest
		truth in the world, and the one
		most persistently disbelieved.</p>

		<p>Happiness, said Carlyle, is as
		the value of a common fraction,
		which results from dividing the
		numerator by the denominator.
		The numerator, in life, is What We
		Have. The denominator is What
		<a class="pagenum" id="page18" title="18"></a>We Think We Ought to Have.
		Mankind may be divided into two
		classes: Fools and Wise. The fools
		are eternally trying to get happiness
		by multiplying the numerator,
		the wise divide the denominator.
		They both come to the
		same&#8212;only one you can do and
		the other is impossible.</p>

		<p>If you have only one thousand
		dollars and think you ought to
		have two thousand dollars, the
		answer is one thousand divided
		by two thousand, which is one
		half. Go and get another thousand
		and you have two thousand
		divided by two thousand, which
		is one; you have doubled your
		contentment. But the trouble is
		that in human affairs as you multiply
		your numerator you unconsciously
		<a class="pagenum" id="page19" title="19"></a>multiply your denominator
		at the same time, and you get
		nowhere. By the time your supply
		reaches two thousand dollars
		your wants have risen to twenty-five
		hundred dollars.</p>

		<p>How much easier simply to reduce
		your Notion of What You
		Ought to Have. Get your idea
		down to one thousand, which you
		can easily do if you know the art
		of self-mastery, and you have one
		thousand divided by one thousand,
		which is one, and a much simpler
		and more sensible process than
		that of trying to get another one
		thousand dollars.</p>

		<p>This is the most valuable secret
		of life. Nothing is of more worth
		to the youth than to awake to the
		truth that he can change his wants.</p>

		<p><a class="pagenum" id="page20" title="20"></a>Not only all happiness, but all
		culture, all spiritual growth, all
		real, inward success, is a process of
		changing one&#8217;s wants.</p>

		<p>So if I were twenty-one I would
		make up my mind to be happy.
		You get about what is coming to
		you, in any event, in this world,
		and happiness and misery depend
		on how you take it; why not be
		happy?</p>
	</div>
	<div id="chapter_vi">
		<h2 class="chapter_title"><a class="pagenum" id="page21" title="21"></a><span class="chapter_number">VI</span><br />

		IF I WERE TWENTY-ONE I WOULD<br />
		GET MARRIED</h2>

		<p>I would not wait until I became
		able to support a wife. I would
		marry while poor, and marry a
		poor girl. I have seen all kinds of
		wives, and by far the greatest
		number of successful ones were
		those that married poor.</p>

		<p>Any man of twenty-one has a
		better chance for happiness, moral
		stature, and earthly success, if
		married than if unmarried.</p>

		<p>I married young, and poor as
		Job&#8217;s turkey. I have been in
		<a class="pagenum" id="page22" title="22"></a>some hard places, seen poverty
		and trial, and I have had more
		than my share of success, but in
		not one instance, either of failure
		or triumph, would I have been
		better off single. My partner in
		this task of living has doubled
		every joy and halved every defeat.</p>

		<p>There&#8217;s a deal of discussion over
		sex problems. There is but one
		wholesome, normal, practical, and
		God-blessed solution to the sex
		question, and that is the loyal love
		of one man and one woman.</p>

		<p>Many young people play the
		fool and marry the wrong person,
		but my observation has been that
		&#8220;there&#8217;s no fool like the old fool,&#8221;
		that the longer marriage is postponed
		the greater are the chances
		of mistake, and that those couples
		<a class="pagenum" id="page23" title="23"></a>are the most successful in matrimony
		who begin in youth and
		grow old together.</p>

		<p>In choosing a wife I would
		insist on three qualifications:</p>

		<p>1. She should be healthy. It
		is all well enough to admire an
		invalid, respect and adore her,
		but a healthy, live man needs a
		healthy woman for his companion,
		if he would save himself a thousand
		ills.</p>

		<p>2. She should have good common
		sense. No matter how pretty
		and charming a fool may be, and
		some of them are wonderfully
		winning, it does not pay to marry
		her. Someone has said that pretty
		women with no sense are like a
		certain cheap automobile: they
		are all right to run around with,
		<a class="pagenum" id="page24" title="24"></a>but you don&#8217;t want to own
		one.</p>

		<p>And 3. She should be cheerful.
		A sunny, brave, bright disposition
		is a wife&#8217;s best dowry.</p>

		<p>As to money, or station in life,
		or cleverness, or good looks, they
		should not enter at all into the
		matter. If I could find a girl,
		healthy, sensible, and cheerful, and
		if I loved her, I&#8217;d marry her, if
		I were twenty-one.</p>

		IF I WERE TWENTY-ONE I WOULD<br />
		SAVE MONEY</h2>

		<p>Money has a deal to do with
		contentment in this workaday
		world, and I&#8217;d have some of my
		own. There isn&#8217;t a human being
		but could save a little. Every
		man, in America at least, could live
		on nine tenths of what he does
		live on, and save the other tenth.
		And the man who regularly saves
		no money is a fool, just a plain fool,
		whether he be an actor getting one
		thousand dollars a week or a ditch-digger
		getting one dollar a day.</p>

		<p><a class="pagenum" id="page26" title="26"></a>And I would get my life insured.
		Life insurance is the most practical
		way for a young man, especially
		if he be a professional man, or
		any one not gifted with the knack
		of making money, to achieve financial
		comfort. The life insurance
		companies are as safe as any money
		institution can be. You are compelled
		to save in order to pay your
		premiums, and you probably need
		that sort of whip. And those dependent
		upon you are protected
		against the financial distress that
		would be caused by your death.
		I believe life insurance to be the
		best way to save money, at least
		for one who knows little about
		money.</p>

		IF I WERE TWENTY-ONE I WOULD<br />
		STUDY THE ART OF PLEASING</h2>

		<p>Much of the content from life
		is due to having pleasant people
		around you. Hence I would form
		habits and cultivate manners that
		would please them.</p>

		<p>For instance, I would make my
		personal appearance as attractive
		as possible. I would look clean,
		well-dressed, and altogether as engaging
		as the material I had to
		work with would allow.</p>

		<p>I would be punctual. To keep
		<a class="pagenum" id="page28" title="28"></a>people waiting is simply insolent
		egotism.</p>

		<p>I would, if my voice were unpleasant,
		have it cultivated until
		it became agreeable in tone. I
		would speak low. I would not
		mumble, but learn the art of clear,
		distinct speech. It is very trying
		to associate with persons who talk
		so that it is a constant effort to
		understand their words.</p>

		<p>I would learn the art of conversation,
		of small talk. I would
		equip myself to be able to entertain
		the grouchiest, most blas&eacute;
		people. For there is hardly a
		business in the world in which it
		is not a great advantage to be
		able to converse entertainingly.</p>

		<p>The secret of being a good conversationalist
		is probably a genuine,
		<a class="pagenum" id="page29" title="29"></a>unselfish interest in others.
		That and practice. It consists
		more in making the other person
		talk than in talking yourself.</p>

		<p>I would learn how to write so
		that it would not burden people
		to read it. In this matter, one
		hint: The English language is composed
		of separate letters, hence,
		when you have written one letter,
		if you will move your pen along
		before you write the next we shall
		be able, probably, to discover
		what you intend, no matter how
		imperfectly you compose your
		separate letters.</p>

		<p>I would not argue. I never
		knew one person in my life that
		was convinced by argument. Discuss,
		yes; but not argue. The
		difference is this: in discussion you
		<a class="pagenum" id="page30" title="30"></a>are searching for the truth, and
		in argument you want to prove
		that you are right. In discussion,
		therefore, you are anxious to know
		your neighbour&#8217;s views, and you
		listen to him. In argument, you
		don&#8217;t care anything about his
		opinions, you want him to hear
		yours; hence, while he&#8217;s talking
		you are simply thinking over what
		you are going to say as soon as
		you get a chance.</p>

		<p>Altogether, I would try to make
		my personality pleasing, so that
		people would in turn endeavour
		to be pleasing to me.</p>

		IF I WERE TWENTY-ONE I WOULD<br />
		DETERMINE, EVEN IF I COULD
		NEVER BE ANYTHING ELSE IN THE
		WORLD, THAT I WOULD BE A THOROUGHBRED</h2>


		<p>Thoroughbred, as it is currently
		used, is a word rather difficult to
		define, perhaps entirely non-definable.
		Yet we all know what it
		means&#8212;it is like Love.</p>

		<p>But it implies being several
		things: One, being a good sport,
		by which I mean the kind of a man
		that does not whine when he fails,
		but gets up smiling and tackles it
		<a class="pagenum" id="page32" title="32"></a>again, the kind of man whose fund
		of cheer and courage does not depend
		upon success, but keeps brave
		and sweet even in failure.</p>

		<p>Let me quote what I have written
		elsewhere on this point:</p>

		<blockquote>
			<p>In one of the plays of this season,
			&#8220;The Very Minute,&#8221; one of the characters
			says something to this effect: You
			go on till you can go no further, you reach
			the limit of human endurance, and then&#8212;you
			hold on another minute, and that&#8217;s
			the minute that counts.</p>

			<p>The idea is a good one. That last
			minute, the other side of the breaking
			point, is worth thinking about.</p>

			<p>It is that which marks the thoroughbred.</p>

			<p>There is a something in the hundredth
			man that bespeaks a finer quality. It is
			unconquerableness, heroism, stick-to-it-iveness,
			or whatever you have a mind
			to call it.</p>

			<p><a class="pagenum" id="page33" title="33"></a>We have a way of attributing this to
			breeding, after the analogy of horses and
			dogs; but while there&#8217;s something in blood
			I doubt if it is a very trustworthy guaranty
			of excellence. So many vigorous
			parents have children that are morally
			spindling, and so many surprising samples
			of superiority come from common stock,
			that heredity is far from dependable.</p>

			<p>But the quality exists, no matter how
			you account for it&#8212;a certain toughness of
			moral fibre, an indestructibility of purpose.</p>

			<p>Any mind is over matter, but there
			are some wills so imperial, so dominant
			over the body, that they keep it from collapse
			even after its strength is spent.</p>

			<p>We see it physically in the prize fighter
			who &#8220;doesn&#8217;t know when he is beaten,&#8221;
			in the race horse that throws an unexpected
			dash into the last stretch even after
			his last ounce of force is gone, in the
			Spartan soldier who exclaimed &#8220;If I fall
			I fight on my knees.&#8221;</p>

			<p>Of all human qualities that have lit
			up the sombreness of this tragic earth,
			<a class="pagenum" id="page34" title="34"></a>I count this, of being a thoroughbred,
			the happiest.</p>

			<p>It has saved more souls than penance
			and punishment, it has rescued more
			business enterprises than shrewdness, it
			has won more battles and more games,
			and altogether felicitously loosed more
			hard knots in the tangled skein of destiny
			than any other virtue.</p>

			<p>Most people are quitters. They reach
			the limit. They are familiar with the
			last straw.</p>

			<p>But the hundredth man is a thoroughbred.
			You cannot corner him. He will
			not give up. He cannot find the word
			&#8220;fail&#8221; in his lexicon. He has never
			learned to whine.</p>

			<p>What shall we do with him? There&#8217;s
			nothing to do but to hand him success.
			It&#8217;s just as well to deliver him the prize,
			for he will get it eventually. There&#8217;s no
			use trying to drown him, for he won&#8217;t sink.</p>

			<p>There&#8217;s only one creature in the world
			better than the man who is a thoroughbred.
			It is the woman who is a thoroughbred.</p>

		IF I WERE TWENTY-ONE I WOULD<br />
		MAKE SOME PERMANENT, AMICABLE
		ARRANGEMENT WITH MY CONSCIENCE</h2>

		<p>God, Duty, Death, and Moral
		Responsibility are huge facts which
		no life can escape. They are the
		external sphinxes by the road of
		every man&#8217;s existence. He must
		frame some sort of an answer to
		them.</p>

		<p>It may please the reader to
		know how I have answered them.
		It is very simple.</p>

		<p>I am familiar, to some extent,
		<a class="pagenum" id="page36" title="36"></a>with most of the religions, cults,
		and creeds of mankind. There
		are certain points common to
		every decent religion, for in every
		kind of church you are taught to
		be honest, pure-minded, unselfish,
		reverent, brave, loyal, and the
		like.</p>

		<p>These elements of religion may
		be called the Great Common Divisor
		of all faiths.</p>

		<p>This G. C. D. is my religion.
		It is what more than fifty years of
		thought and experience has winnowed
		out for me. It is my religion.
		And I think I glimpse
		what Emerson meant when he
		wrote that &#8220;all good men are of
		one religion.&#8221;</p>

		<p>And the matter can be reduced
		to yet plainer terms. There is but
		<a class="pagenum" id="page37" title="37"></a>&#8220;one thing needful,&#8221; and there&#8217;s
		no use being &#8220;careful and troubled
		about many things.&#8221; That one
		thing is to <em>do right</em>.</p>

		<p>To do Right and not Wrong will
		save any man&#8217;s soul, and if he believes
		any doctrine that implies
		doing wrong he is lost.</p>

		<p>So, let a man of twenty-one
		resolve, and keep his purpose,
		that, no matter what comes, no
		matter how mixed his theology
		may be, no matter what may be
		the rewards of wrong-doing, or
		the perils and losses of right-doing,
		he will do right; then, if there
		is any moral law in the universe,
		that man must sometime, somewhere,
		arrive at his inward triumph,
		his spiritual victory and
		peace.</p>

		<p><a class="pagenum" id="page38" title="38"></a>And the corollary of this is that
		if I have done wrong the best and
		only way to cure it is to quit
		doing wrong and begin to do right.
		If any man will stick to this, make
		it his anchor in times of storm, his
		pole-star in nights of uncertainty,
		he will cast out of his life that which
		is life&#8217;s greatest enemy&#8212;Fear. He
		need not fear man nor woman,
		nor governments nor mischief-makers,
		nor the devil nor God.
		He will be able to say with the
		accent of sincerity that word of
		William Ernest Henley, to me the
		greatest spiritual declaration in
		any language:</p>

		<div class="poem">
			<div class="stanza">
				<p>Out of the night that covers me,</p>
				<p class="i2">Black as the pit from Pole to Pole,</p>
				<p>I thank whatever gods may be</p>
				<p class="i2">For my unconquerable soul.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="stanza">
				<p><a class="pagenum" id="page39" title="39"></a>In the fell clutch of circumstance</p>
				<p class="i2">I have not winced nor cried aloud,</p>
				<p>Beneath the bludgeonings of chance</p>
				<p class="i2">My head is bloody, but unbowed.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="stanza">
				<p>It matters not how strait the gate,</p>
				<p class="i2">How charged with punishments the scroll,</p>
				<p>I am the master of my fate,</p>
				<p class="i2">I am the captain of my soul.</p>
			</div>
		</div>

		<p>Let me repeat that I have not
		been telling what I did with the
		implication that the youth of
		twenty-one would do well to follow
		me. I did not do all these
		things. Far from it! I wish I had.
		I only say that if I were twenty-one,
		as I now see life, I would
		do as I have here suggested. But
		perhaps I would not. I might go
		about barking my shins and burning
		my fingers, making idiotic
		<a class="pagenum" id="page40" title="40"></a>experiments in the endeavour to
		prove that I was an exception to
		all the rules, and knew a little
		more than all the ancients. So
		let not the young man be discouraged
		if he has committed follies;
		for there seems to emerge a peculiar
		and vivid wisdom from
		error, from making an ass of
		one&#8217;s self, and all that, more useful
		to one&#8217;s own life than any wisdom
		he can get from sages or
		copybooks.</p>

		<p>In what I have written I have
		not tried to indicate the art of
		&#8220;getting on,&#8221; or of acquiring riches
		or position. These usually are what
		is meant by success. But success
		is of two kinds, outward and inward,
		or apparent and real. Outward
		success may depend somewhat
		<a class="pagenum" id="page41" title="41"></a>upon what is in you, but it depends
		more upon luck. It is a gambling
		game. And it is hardly worth a
		strong man&#8217;s while. Inward and
		real success, on the contrary, is
		not an affair of chance at all, but
		is as certain as any natural law.
		Any human being that will observe
		the laws of life as carefully as
		successful business men observe
		the laws of business will come to
		that inward poise and triumph
		which is life&#8217;s happiest crown, as
		certainly as the stars move in
		their courses.</p>

		<p>I would, therefore, if I were
		twenty-one, study the art of life.
		It is good to know arithmetic
		and geography and bookkeeping
		and all practical matters, but it is
		better to know how to live, how
		<a class="pagenum" id="page42" title="42"></a>to spend your day so that at the
		end of it you shall be content,
		how to spend your life so that you
		feel it has been worth while.</p>
